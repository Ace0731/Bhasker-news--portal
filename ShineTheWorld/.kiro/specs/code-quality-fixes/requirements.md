# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical code quality issues, security vulnerabilities, and compatibility problems identified in the ShineTheWorld ASP.NET Core application. The improvements will enhance security, maintainability, and reliability while ensuring proper .NET 8.0 compatibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to use proper .NET 8.0 compatible packages, so that the application builds and runs correctly without version conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is built THEN the system SHALL use only .NET 8.0 compatible packages
2. WHEN authentication is configured THEN the system SHALL use built-in ASP.NET Core authentication without external package dependencies
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL not throw any package compatibility errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean, maintainable code without duplicates or syntax issues, so that the codebase is professional and easy to work with.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code files are compiled THEN the system SHALL not contain duplicate using statements
2. WHEN code is reviewed THEN the system SHALL follow consistent coding patterns
3. WHEN null references are accessed THEN the system SHALL use proper null checking instead of null-forgiving operators

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want user passwords to be securely hashed, so that user credentials are protected against common attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL hash passwords using a cryptographically secure algorithm like BCrypt
2. WHEN passwords are validated THEN the system SHALL use the same secure hashing mechanism
3. WHEN password hashing is implemented THEN the system SHALL use proper salt generation and verification

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear and consistent subscription logic, so that subscription status is handled predictably throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking subscription status THEN the system SHALL have clear logic for null expiry dates
2. WHEN subscription expires THEN the system SHALL correctly identify expired subscriptions
3. WHEN subscription logic is implemented THEN the system SHALL handle edge cases consistently

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling in controllers, so that the application gracefully handles failures and provides meaningful feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN service operations fail THEN the system SHALL catch exceptions and return appropriate HTTP responses
2. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages to users
3. WHEN unexpected errors happen THEN the system SHALL log errors for debugging purposes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper input validation and security measures, so that the application is protected against common web vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user input is processed THEN the system SHALL validate all inputs at the service layer
2. WHEN sensitive operations are performed THEN the system SHALL ensure proper authorization
3. WHEN CSRF attacks are attempted THEN the system SHALL be protected by proper token validation
